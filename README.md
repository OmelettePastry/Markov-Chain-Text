# Markov-Chain-Text
Generating sentences using a Markov Chain

This program reads a text file and stores all unique words in a dictionary, as well as the words that succeed them (with their probabilities) in a Markov chain. This Markov chain is then used to create a sentence based on the probabilities of a successive word.
